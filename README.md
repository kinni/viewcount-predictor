# Prediction API: How popular my article will be?

This is source project for my sharing on GDG HK DevFest 2016. We have talked about the Google Cloud Prediction API. In this project, we will use news article titles to predict the number of view counts.

## Getting Started

This repo has 2 projects. 

`appledaily-scraper` is a simple Node.js application to scrape Apple Daily website to get the news article title and view count. 

`vuewcount-predictor` is the web app serving as the frontend to interact with Google Cloud Prediction API.
